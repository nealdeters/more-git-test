# Create the same program that was used to put your class into groups! Have the program request the user to enter each studentâ€™s names.  Assume the classroom has an even number of students, so there are only groups of two. For example, you can have the program output groups like so:
#   Group: Hermione Seamus
#       Group: Lucius Cho
#       Group: Sirius Luna
#       Group: Severus Draco
students = []
input = ""

puts "Please enter all of your students names: "

until input == "done"
  input = gets.chomp

  if input == "done" 
    break
  else
    students << input
  end

end

#group the students by 2's
students.shuffle!
# students.each_slice!(2).to_a
students.each do |student|
  puts "Group: #{students[student]} #{students[student]}"
end

#randomize the students
