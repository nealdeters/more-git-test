# Create the same program that was used to put your class into groups! Have the program request the user to enter each studentâ€™s names.  Assume the classroom has an even number of students, so there are only groups of two. For example, you can have the program output groups like so:
#   Group: Hermione Seamus
#       Group: Lucius Cho
#       Group: Sirius Luna
#       Group: Severus Draco

#Collect a list of names
students = []
input = ""

puts "Please enter all of your students names: "

until input == "done"
  unless input == ""
    students << input
  end

  input = gets.chomp
end

#shuffle the list of names
mixed_students = students.shuffle

#group names together by 2's
#when i have an odd number of names, the last group should be a group of 3

until mixed_students.length == 0

  group = mixed_students.pop(2)

  print "Group: "
  group.each do |member|
    print "#{member} "
  end
  puts ""
  print "\n"
end

#p mixed_students
